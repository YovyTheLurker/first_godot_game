# first_godot_game

Here are all the files for the project I'm currently working on.  I am following the tutorials on the book "Godot Engine Game Development Projects." 

The author of this book is working on Godot 3.0 as of the publishing of the book.  There is a new version of Godot out and I'm not sure how this affects the instructions themselves. 

With that said, the instructions in the book themselves do have errors.  I find myself swiming the web looking for solutions.  And, although the author have github repository with the code, I have also noted errors or oversight (maybe some key info to make the code work was obmitted) on the authors errata files.

With all of that said, I am glad I got the book, I just wish for a revised edition with all the wrinkles ironed out.
